I am currently a PhD student majored in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Florida State University.  
I work on machine learning under the supervision of [Dr.Barbu](https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~abarbu/) and focus on the 
application of deep learning to Self-driving car, Advertisement and 
E-commerce. I internshiped at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and worked on high 
performance computing in 2017. I also internshiped at [Weride.ai](https://www.weride.ai/) and explored the 
application of deep reinforcement learning on the Planning & Control of Autonomous Vehicle in 2018. Most recently, 
I applied deep learning (CNN and RNN) to scene text understanding in ads and e-commerce at 
[kwai.inc](http://www.kwai.com/) in 2020 as a machine learning research intern. I received master degree in 
engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and bachelor degree in engineering from Xi'an Jiao Tong University. 
I am a recipient of [NSF-MSGI](https://orise.orau.gov/nsf-msgi/) Fellowship.

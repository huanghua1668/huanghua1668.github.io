I am currently a PhD student majored in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Florida State University. I work on machine learning and focus on the application of deep learning to Self-driving car, Advertisement and E-commerce. I internshiped at [Larence Berkeley National Labtory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and worked on high performance computing in 2017. I also internshiped at [Weride.ai](https://www.weride.ai/) and explored the application of deep reinforcement learning on the Planning & Control of Autonomous Vehicle in 2018. Most recently, I applied deep learning(CNN and RNN) to scene text understanding in ads and e-commerce at [kwai.inc](http://www.kwai.com/) in 2020 as a machine learning research intern. I received Master degrees in engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am a recipient of [NSF-MSGI](https://orise.orau.gov/nsf-msgi/) Fellowship.

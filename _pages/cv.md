Education
======
* B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, Xi'an Jiao Tong University, 2010
* M.S. in Aerospace Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2013
* Ph.D in Applied and Computational Mathematics, Florida State University, 2021 (expected)

Work experience
======
* May 2020 - Aug 2020: Machine Learning Reseach Intern, Kwai.inc
  * Ads ranking on video-sharing app with 200 million DAU.
  * E-commerce ads content understanding (Scene Text Recoginition with deep learning)

* May 2019 - Aug 2019: SDE intern, Weride.ai
  * Designed an intelligent human driver agent which has multiple behavioral intentions
  * Prototyped the application of reinforcement learning algorithm (DP, DQN) to solve lane change problem for Autonomous Vehicle, achieved zero collision out of 1 million episode of lane changes
  
* June 2017 - Aug 2017: Computational Science Summer Student Internship (NSF Mathematics Science Graduate Internship), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
  * Developed code based on AMReX, which is a massively parallel adaptive mesh refinement framework, to solve wave equations in C++ and Fortran
  * Added node-level parallelism with a MPI plus Open MP approach. Improved thread scalability by experimenting the combination of MPI tasks and threads, achieved 1.5x speed up compared with pure MPI approach
 
Research experience
======
* Sep 2017 - Present: Research Assistant, Florida State University
  * Extracted and labeled 120000 vehicle trajectories with a total driven distance of 45000km.
  * Trained Logistic Regression/Support Vector Machine/LSTM models to predict human intentions by learning from human driving dataset. Achieved 87.8% accuracy in predicting cooperative/adversarial behavior in lane change.
  * Trained a Compact Support Neural Network (CSNN) to detect long-tail rare events. CSNN obtained similar accuracy in classifying in-distribution samples compared with normal neuron based network, and achieved AUC of 0.98 in detecting out-of-distribution samples.

title: "Playing Atari games with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "With options (i.e., multiple step actions) learned from manual book, hierarchical reinforcement learning
achieve human-level learning efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in playing challenge games, e.g., Tennis,
Pong, etc. <br/> <img src='/images/tennis.png' width='500'>"

We experimentally demonstrate that by decomposing the learning task into sub-systems and constructing options
for the temporally extended planning, the learning process can be dramatically accelerated.

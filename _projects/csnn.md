title: "Build a lane change decision model with Compact Support Neural Network"
excerpt: "One of the biggest obstacles in deploying Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is that without vehicle-to-vehicle
communication, AV has to be able to predict human driver's intentions and planning and control its action accordingly,
while equally importantly, AV also has to behave just like a typical human driver such that other road users can infer
the AV's intentions. We propose to learn the human driver's mental model in lane change decision making.

## Introduction
The current mainstream Planning & Control (P&C) algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is rule-based. There are 
lots of redundancy in the system and AV is overly defensive in scenarios need interaction with other road users, e.g.,
lane change, merge, unprotected left turn, roundabouts, etc. Indecisiveness will confuse other road users and block 
traffic. We propose to use data-driven approach to learn the human driver's mental model in lane change decision making.

Deep learning has very successful applications in object classification, language translation, game playing and
many others, but it's overconfident in its application
([see paper here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Hein_Why_ReLU_Networks_Yield_High-Confidence_Predictions_Far_Away_From_the_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)) 
In out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, it will still confidently output a prediction, i.e., it does 
not know when it's unknown.

A Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network (NN) is trained on the Moon dataset. As we can see in the figure, 
NN has very high confidence in OOD samples far from its training dataset. 

If we want to apply NN to P&C of AV industry, we must be able to assess the confidence in our prediction, as one 
decision can be a matter of life and death. When the confidence is low and uncertainty is high, a conservative action 
should be pursued. 

## Compact Support Neural Network (CSNN)
We propose the Compact Support Neural Network (CSNN), in which neuron will have a compact support and NN can output
zero confidence for OOD samples. The activation of neuron is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
	f( x)&=&\max(R^2-|| x- \mu||^2,0) \nonumber \\ 
	    &=&\max(\alpha(R^2- x^T x- \mu^T \mu)+2 \mu^T x,0)
\end{eqnarray}
When $\alpha=0$, it will be a standard ReLU neuron, and when $\alpha>0$, it will be a
Compact Support Neuron. It can be shown that the neuron only has support within a ball of 
radius
\begin{eqnarray}
	R_\alpha^2=R^2+||\mu||^2(\frac{1}{\alpha^2}-1)
\end{eqnarray}
and center 
\begin{equation}
    c=\frac{\mu}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

As we can see in the figure, with compact support, the NN output almost 0 confidence when samples are far from training
dataset.


## Experiments
### NGSIM dataset and OOD samples
We train the CSNN algorithm on the 
[NGSIM I80 dataset](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/06137/index.cfm), which is a 
45-minute video recoding of a 500-meter long highway. We extracted all the lane changes and labeled them
into 3 categories:
* Cooperative. Ego (i.e., the agent which carries out lane change) changes lane and does not cause a harsh 
brake for the lag vehicle in target lane.
<br/><img src='/images/lc_coop.png' width='500'>
* Adversarial. Ego changes lane and causes a harsh brake for the lag vehicle in target lane. 
<br/><img src='/images/lc_adv.png' width='500'>
* Adversarial. Ego aborts the current window due to competition and chooses to change lane in the next window.
<br/><img src='/images/lc_adv_merge_after.png' width='500'>

We then generate the OOD samples with uniform sampling. Overall, 153509 OOD samples are generated and there are 
1584 in-distribution samples.

### Model
A network of:
 * A fully connected layer with 64 neurons and $reLU$ activation
 * Batch normalization layer without affine learning, i.e., normalize the output of previous layer such that 
 they have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation.
 * A fully connected layer with 64 Compact Support Neurons with hyperparameter $r=1$.
 * Output layer with 2 heads.
 
 
### Results
 The model has obtained accuracy 0.833 and AUC of 0.99 when $\alpha=0.325$, which is better than the state-of-the-art 
 result, i.e., result using [deterministic uncertainty quantification (DUQ)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02037), which
 has best result of accuracy 0.824 and AUC of 0.98. Another popular method in detecting OOD samples, deep ensemble, 
 completely failed in this task. A ensemble of 5 NN has AUC of 0.396, we suspect in low-dimension space, the individual 
 network tends to agree with each other on the OOD samples and the entropy of prediction is low instead of high.

## Conclusion
The Compact Support Neural Network can have the same prediction accuracy for in-distribution samples compared with
classifiers trained with normal neurons and beat state-of-the-art results in detecting OOD samples. It can be a 
great algorithm to detect long-tail rare events.
